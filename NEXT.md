## #96 — A Conditions field on the Evaluate card (**done, deployed**)

**Accepted and built 26 Aug 2026.** Roberto's request: give **Evaluate** a
*Conditions* field, like **Solve** already has. It does the two things he
chose:

* `t = to` is a **substitution**, applied before the expression is
  evaluated -- the calculator's `vc|t=to`, which is what the box is mostly
  for. Verified in the browser against a real solve: `vc` with `t = to`
  reads `V - V*exp(-to/(c*r))`.
* `pr1 > 0` is an **assumption**, translated into the predicate `refine()`
  wants. That translation is the whole trick: `refine(sqrt(x**2), x > 0)`
  hands the expression straight back, while `refine(sqrt(x**2),
  Q.positive(x))` gives `x`. Verified both ways round -- `x > 0` gives `x`,
  `x < 0` gives `-x`, neither gives `sqrt(x**2)`.

An equality with anything but a single name on the left is refused, with a
message pointing at the Solve card, rather than quietly ignored: Evaluate
substitutes and formats, it does not solve.

Where it went, beyond the field itself:

* **The input file.** `evaluate_conditions`, one per line, in
  `circuitbook.py`'s `_MULTI` and in the writer beside `evaluate:`; the
  `inputsSnapshot()` / `applyCircuit()` pair; and the key list in the page's
  own Input File help. Named for its card, like `solve_conditions`, so it
  cannot collide with a circuit's Expert Mode `conditions` -- round-tripped
  through `format_book`/`parse_book` and confirmed the three stay apart.
* **The domain-sensitive inputs.** It posts `domain` with the rest, as
  Evaluate and Solve equations already did, so `{...}` keeps meaning what it
  means in FD and nothing else.
* `STALE_ON_CHANGE`, so editing it retires a fresh Evaluate result --
  checked in the browser, the button drops out of `is-current` on the first
  keystroke. The post-solve enable pass. "Clear all inputs". And the
  downloaded report, which now prints the conditions under the expression
  and only while both fields still hold what produced the result.

Guarded like the Solve card's box, not like an expression: `_ALLOWED` has no
`=`, `<` or `>` in it, so it was the wrong guard and rejected every
condition on the first try. `_ALLOWED_COND`, `_MAX_SOLVE_EQS`,
`MAX_EXTRA_LEN` and `_expand_and` are what the Solve card uses, and now what
this uses.

The offline build has it too: `bridge.py` reads the box, `build_local.py`
rewrites the new fetch, and `index.html` is regenerated and `--check` clean.

**Not deployed.** The chain when it goes: `build_local.py` →
`build_zip.py --assets ../../local` → `stage_install_site.py` →
`deploy_symbulator.py install` and `zip`, plus a `CACHE_VERSION` bump in
`sw.js`. PythonAnywhere is Roberto's to reload. The documentation's #89
becomes writable once it is live, and not before.


## #95 — There is no version 9 way to say `vc|t=to` (**done, deployed**)

**Fixed 26 Aug 2026.** `t = to` now works in the Solve card as well as in
Evaluate's new Conditions box.

**The first diagnosis was backwards and is worth recording as such.** The
note said a typed `t` was a plain `Symbol("t")` while the answers carried
the nonnegative one. The opposite is true: `_allowed_namespace` has bound
`t` to `symbulator.laplace.t` all along, so every box on the page has always
parsed `t` correctly. It is the **answers** that lose it. A solved answer
crosses to the browser as a string and is read back by `_alias_mapping` with
bare `sp.sympify`, which knows nothing of that namespace and makes a plain
`Symbol("t")`. Different symbol, `subs()` does nothing, nothing says so.

Two lines, once it was aimed at the right side:

* `_alias_mapping` canonicalises `t` as it re-reads each answer.
* `solveq_ui` built its unknowns as `sp.Symbol(u)`, so an unknown named `t`
  was a third, plain `t` that appeared in none of the equations and left the
  system unsolved. It canonicalises them too.

And `real_only` no longer re-declares a symbol that already carries an
assumption implying real -- doing so threw the nonnegative away and put the
mismatch back for exactly the circuits that needed it.

Measured after: `t = to` gives `x = V - V*exp(-to/(c*r))`, `t = 0` gives 0,
both with and without "real solutions only"; leaving `t` free is unchanged;
and the Solve card's own conditions still filter roots, `w**2 = 4` with
`w > 0` still coming back as just `2`.

The docs' `README.md` says this trap is about `Symbol("t", positive=True)`.
It is `nonnegative` -- laplace changed it deliberately, because DiracDelta
of a strictly positive argument evaluates to 0 and every impulse vanished.
Worth correcting there.


## #94 — A number glued to an answer name silently unbinds it (**done, deployed**)

**Fixed 26 Aug 2026.** `.2v1` and `3ir1` now bind, with no `*` and no
underscore, which is how both 2023 pages are written.

Implied multiplication was never the problem: `3t`, `2(a+b)`, `2e^(-2t)` and
`2ir1` were all read as products already. The problem was that
`_alias_pattern` refused to rewrite `v1` into `v_1` with a digit against it,
and ran before `si_prefix` made the multiplication explicit -- so by the time
the `*` arrived, `v1` was an ordinary symbol. The circuit then solved, in
terms of a variable the reader thought was a node voltage, and nothing
anywhere said so. With a current-controlled source it was worse:
`e,2,3,3ir1` in a two-port answered
`a11 = -30.0*x_test1/(3.0*ir1 - 20.0*x_test1)`, leaking the tool's own
internal probe names onto the page.

The pattern now consumes an optional number in front of the name and emits
the multiplication itself. Consumed rather than merely allowed, so the guard
still holds inside a name: in `x2v1` neither the number nor the name can
start, and nothing matches, which is right. Scientific notation is safe for
a different reason -- an alias is a quantity letter plus an element name,
and `e3` is not one.

Measured after: `.2v1`, `0.2v1`, `2v1`, `.2*v1` and `0.2v_1` all resolve;
HK5's Drill Problem 1-13 gives -2, 3, -8 and -0.5 from the panel as the
2023 page writes it. `.2 v1`, with a space, is still refused, unchanged.

**Still worth having:** nothing catches this class automatically. The docs'
`tools/check_v9_panels.py` asks only whether a panel is *read*, and these
were read perfectly. A check that a solved panel's answers carry no
unexpected free symbols would sit well beside it.


## #77 — TR read its sources in the s-domain (**done, deployed**)

**Settled 25 Aug 2026, in solver 0.5.5.** It was a port omission, not a
design choice, and the primary source proves it.

`tr()` called `fd()` and inverse-transformed the answers, but passed the
source values through untouched -- so they were read as s-domain
expressions. Every transient answer was one integration short: a plain
`12` gave the impulse response where the step response was meant,
plausible enough to pass a glance.

The evidence, in the order it got firmer:

1. Version 7's `.tig` is a plain zip; raw ASCII showed `s	2s` beside a
   `tool="tr"` test. Suggestive, and the technique is low-confidence.
2. Version 8's documentation agreed -- but Roberto pointed out it is an
   unfinished clone of version 7's and not evidence of intent.
3. `PROJECT_HISTORY.md`, bundled in `symbulator-project.skill`, recorded
   the omission at the time: the port skipped the forward transform
   "rather than auto-detecting and transforming time-domain expressions
   **the way the original did**", because the `lf\laplace` library was
   not in the source dump.
4. Version 8's actual source, decoded with `tnstools` (3DES in counter
   mode -- which is why the payload is not block-aligned, the detail that
   made it look like something other than encryption). `symbv8s5`:

       If betatool="tr" and inString("ej",kind) Then
         value depends on t     -> t2s(value)
         value is a constant    -> value/s
         refers to another answer -> left alone

0.5.5 restores exactly that. A controlled source is left alone because
its value is a relation, not a waveform; a value already written in `s`
is left alone too, which is what keeps every existing version 9
description working.

Verified before shipping: all twelve bundled examples answered
byte-identically under published 0.5.4 and the new build, and six
transient circuits now match answers derived by hand -- including AS7's
Example 16.1, whose answer is in print in both calculator versions.

Two things fell out of it. 0.5.3 had bound `t` in the parsing namespace to
`Symbol("t", positive=True)`, and SymPy evaluates `DiracDelta` of a
strictly positive argument to **zero** -- so impulse sources had been
silently erased. And 0.5.6 added the `{...}` shorthand, `symbv8si`'s
FD-only marker for a source written in time.

The decoded version 8 source is worth keeping: it turns "what did the
original do?" from inference into a grep.

## #75 — The lockup exists once, not once per tree (**done, deployed everywhere**)

**Done 23 Aug 2026.** Where: `server/templates/index.html` (commit `8585e70`),
`local/build_local.py` (`check_banner`).

`Sym Docum\Documentation\design\banner.css` is now the only place the lockup is
stated. The app's header was renamed to the shared class names -- `.topbar`
wrapping `.topbar-inner`, `.header-flex` to `.header-brand`, `header h1` to
`.brand-name`, `header p` to `.brand-sub` -- and the file is inlined verbatim
into the template between `BEGIN/END banner.css` markers. Inlined rather than
linked because the offline ZIP cannot fetch a stylesheet from another tree.

The guard is the part that works. `check_banner()` in `build_local.py` compares
the inlined block against the source and stops the build if they differ, naming
the fix; it warns and carries on when `Sym Docum` is absent, so `repos/` alone
still produces a release. The app's own controls stay in the app, layered on top
exactly as the version picker is on `learn` and the nav links on the landing
page.

Left open, deliberately: the app's build now reads a file from a tree that is
**not under version control**. Moving `banner.css` into `repos/local` and having
the docs' `build.py` read it from there would invert that dependency. Worth
doing when `Sym Docum` becomes a repo; nothing breaks meanwhile.

## #74 — The app and the two websites are different shapes (**done, deployed**)

**Settled 23 Aug 2026, by the app adopting two bands.** The websites had been
changed to a two-band header -- `.topbar` carrying the lockup alone with no
keyline, `.subbar` beneath it carrying every control in a lighter navy
(`#2a4576`) and the 3px sky keyline closing the pair -- hours after the app had
been brought into line with the older single-band design. The app followed the
websites, which were the reference it had been asked to match, rather than the
websites reverting.

**Reopened 23 Aug 2026: the app took the file, not the shape.** Measured in a
browser at 1280 wide, the same viewport for all three properties:

| | symbulator.com | learn.symbulator.com | the app |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.topbar` | 149 | 149 | 149 |
| `.subbar` | 62 | 62 | **absent** |
| where the controls sit | subbar, left edge | subbar, left edge | **inside the lockup band, right** |
| keyline | on `.subbar` | on `.subbar` | on `.topbar`, via `:last-child` |

The lockup band itself matches to the pixel, which is what `check_banner()`
guards and why this passed unnoticed: the shared file styles `.subbar`, and the
app has no element with that class. `banner.css` even anticipates it -- the
`.topbar:last-child` rule that gives the app its keyline exists for a header
with no ribbon.

What was left to do was markup, not CSS: wrap the app's theme toggle in
`<div class="subbar"><div class="subbar-inner">`, in
`repos/server/templates/index.html`. The keyline then moves to the subbar on its
own, because `:last-child` stops matching.

**Closed 26 Aug 2026.** The markup is in and live, and this time measured
rather than read -- the item's own point being that a file check is not a
shape check. Both at 1280 wide, in a browser, against the deployed sites:

| | install.symbulator.com | learn.symbulator.com |
|---|---|---|
| `.topbar` height | 149 | 149 |
| `.topbar` bottom border | none | none |
| `.subbar` height | 62 | 62 |
| `.subbar` keyline | 3px `rgb(142,199,245)` | 3px `rgb(142,199,245)` |
| controls in the subbar | yes | yes |

Which is the table above with the "absent" filled in.

The drift itself is the lesson, and #75 is the answer to it -- but only for the
part a byte comparison can see. This happened twice in one day, in both
directions, while every session involved was being careful, because three files
each stated the lockup and nothing compared them. A file check is not a shape
check.

## #73 — Stale "several solutions" picker (**done, deployed everywhere**)

**Found by Roberto, 22 Aug 2026.** Where: `server/templates/index.html`,
`markStale()`.

Solve a circuit with two roots, then pick a different entry from the circuit
menu: the "2 solutions fit the circuit as described" line and its picker
stayed on screen, now describing a circuit no longer in the form.

The cause was where the reset lived, not what it did. `buildSolutionPicker({})`
was called from exactly two places -- the start of a solve, and
`clearResults()` -- so every *other* way of invalidating a solve left the
picker behind. It now happens inside `markStale('solve')`, which every such
path already goes through, including `applyCircuit()`, whose own comment
states the rule: *loading a circuit rewrites every field and fires no events
doing it, so nothing on screen describes these inputs any more*. The line and
the menu are part of "nothing on screen".

Verified: picker clears on loading another entry and on editing a field, and
survives switching between solutions, which marks the solve fresh rather than
stale.

## #72 — Clear-all button press nudge (**done, deployed everywhere**)

**Done 22 Aug 2026, deployed 23 Aug in the `09:25 UTC` build.** Where:
`server/templates/index.html`, commit `e4b95d7`; regenerated in
`local/index.html`, commit `2560acd`.

The button beside the Inputs heading is centred with a transform, and every
button on the site gets a 1px press nudge that is also a transform. A second
transform replaces the first rather than adding to it, and `:active` is the
more specific selector, so pressing the button discarded its centring and it
fell 20px -- half its own 37px height, plus the nudge -- gliding down and back
because `transform` is transitioned. Fixed by carrying both offsets together
as `translateY(calc(-50% + 1px))`, with the narrow-screen branch reset to the
plain nudge since the button is not centred there.

It was held back at the time as cosmetic, on the grounds that shipping it alone
costs a full three-site round, and folded into the next deploy that had a reason
to happen. Verified live: `translateY(calc(-50% + 1px))` is present in the page
served by `https://install.symbulator.com/` as well as in
`C:\Users\perez\Claude Code\Symbulator\repos\local\index.html`.

## #59 — Bracket typos quote the rewritten value, not what was typed

**Accepted 23 Aug 2026, for the next solver release.** Where:
`solver/symbulator/si_prefix.py`, around `expand_shorthand` and
`check_expression_syntax`.

`[a,b]` (parallel impedance) is rewritten to `pr(a,b)` and SI prefixes are
expanded *before* the value is parsed, so an error message quotes the
rewritten string. Type `[1'k,2'k` and you are told about
`pr(1*10**3,2*10**3`; type `rx[1'k]` and you get a bare
`'Symbol' object is not callable`.

Nothing is mis-solved -- every case is refused, never answered wrongly -- and
it is not a security gap: the syntax gate is intact, and `x(0)` is legitimate
input that SymPy then rejects on its own. It is a papercut on a feature
students are meant to use: the error is about internals rather than about
their circuit. The fix is to carry the original text alongside the rewritten
one and quote the original.

Not worth a release of its own -- fold it into whatever next takes the
solver to a new version, which means a version bump, a PyPI publish and
a rebundled wheel in the offline builds.
